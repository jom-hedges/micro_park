# MicroPark

A learning project regarding adaptive video streaming based on a similar website found in Are.na and the paper titled "Learning *in situ*: a randomized experiment in video streaming" by Francis Y. Yan et al.

Learning about using machine learning to improve and learn about video-streaming algorithms.

The authors of the paper state that they are attempting to teach a computer to design new algorithms that reduce stalls in streaming, improve picture quality, and predict how the capacity of an Internet connection will change over time.
